# This file needs to load:
  # Andrena bee community data in `sites; sp; freq` format
    # those are restricted to a geografical area, effort and timing of collection
  # Andrena traits, specially phenology and oligolecty
  # Is the rest of the community important? that is, should we include total bee richness/abundance
  # Is habitat important? can habitat modulate the coexistance of some species pairs? I can get GIS, I guess.

# Will will add add the phylogeny too.
# Not sure what will happen next.
